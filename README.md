# Overview of the AirBnB Clone Project

## üöÄ Objective
The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.
## üèÜ Project Goals
1. **User Management:** Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
2. **Property Management:** Develop features for property listing, creation, updates, and retrieval.
3. **Booking System:** Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
4. **Payment Processing:** Integrate a payment system to handle transactions between users and hosts, and record payment details.
5. **Review System:** Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
6. **Data Optimization:** Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.
